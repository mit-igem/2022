- Expand upon your Silver medal work for Proposed Implementation and develop a proof of concept for your project.

- A proof of concept usually consists of experiments or prototypes that demonstrate that your project is likely to work in a relevant context.
  - Your Proof of Concept should reflect your project as a whole, not just a single aspect or component
  - Depending on your project, this criterion may require labwork. Software- or hardware-based projects may not require labwork for a successful proof of concept
