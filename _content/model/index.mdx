- Gold medal criterion 3
  - Use modeling to gain insight into how your project works or should be implemented. Explain your model's assumptions, data, parameters, and results in a way that anyone could understand.
- Best model special prize
  - Models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the functioning and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic biology is an engineering discipline and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to determine system behavior before building your design. Designing and simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab. This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform system design or simulate expected behavior before or in conjunction with experiments in the wetlab.
