- Demonstrate engineering success in a part of your project by going through at least one iteration of the engineering design cycle. This achievement should be distinct from your Contribution for Bronze.
- Engineering success can be achieved by making an effort to follow the engineering design cycle: Design → Build → Test → Learn → Design...
  - We invite you to think about ways to tackle and solve one or more of your project's problems and use synthetic biology tools to generate expected results.
  - If you are unable to get into a lab, how would you design your experiments, evaluate the outcome, deal with unexpected results, and plan further steps?
  - You can design and build a new Part and show that it works as expected (documentation must be on the Part's Pages on the Registry)
  - See the Engineering pages for additional guidance on engineering success.
